The Weighted Mean

In some cases, you might want a number to have more weight. In that case, youâ€™ll want to find the weighted mean.
To find the weighted mean:

Multiply the numbers in your data set by the weights.
Add the results up.

For that set of number above with equal weights (1/5 for each number), the math to find the weighted mean would be:
1(*1/5) + 3(*1/5) + 5(*1/5) + 7(*1/5) + 10(*1/5) = 5.2.

Example problem: You take three 100-point exams in your statistics class and score 80, 80 and 95.
The last exam is much easier than the first two, so your professor has given it less weight.
The weights for the three exams are:

Exam 1: 40 % of your grade. (Note: 40% as a decimal is .4.)
Exam 2: 40 % of your grade.
Exam 3: 20 % of your grade.
What is your final weighted average for the class?

Multiply the numbers in your data set by the weights:
.4(80) = 32
.4(80) = 32
.2(95) = 19
Add the numbers up. 32 + 32 + 19 = 83.
