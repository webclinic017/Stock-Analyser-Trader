Computer Science IA,

make a model to go through all the x years of news and measure the percentage fluctuation in the price
action and find a average,

also find out what affects that category of stocks the most... like news, or interest rates...
then create a model that weights in certain factor more over another for categories of stocks...
if one stock is like in tech but hyped up it will be calculated two times, both results will be shown

combine the twitter analysis... news (got some apis in safari), etc...
also, will get data from multiple apis... some of which will be mine own.
then the app will also have a api for itself which can be called, so not just an gui interface, but
also an option to interact with the api.

all the news, earnings, etc. will be stored in a database, different tables... so that we can query
things like which is the day the news is announced most likely... stuff like that etc.

calculate the derivative of the stock graph, see for breakouts before by calculating the second derivative.


and then we can also add in an AI model to predict things for the improvement part and start to work some
of it towards the end and that final could go on the resume, like i continued on the project later on.

some aspects have I have already done before... look in the drive...


Also:
make it look at the VIX to see the market volatility to predict the price movement or also the quarterly reports
add a backtesting to test how the algorithm or trading strategy would have performed.

Backtest the strategy for all the stocks, of course make a shortlist, then test the strategy with different
parameters for example, for the SMA crossover, try with all the possible (and reasonable) smas, then get the
performance data for each one of them and see what's worked the best for that stock over the time and use that
KIND OF LIKE A SIMULATION...

See what data are available in platforms like webull and try to make use of that too...


Check the gradient of the moving averages and if it's relatively flat, do nothing.
