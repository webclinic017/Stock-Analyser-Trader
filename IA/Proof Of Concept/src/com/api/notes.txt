It's just nuts to implement in java and alot of things could go wrong

so interface with python...

send the data to python on what trades i want to execute

python will execute the trades with it's purpose built package, an excuse that
it's safe to do it that way as it want meant to be used like that...

I say open up a flask server which accepts things like this...

And also change the svg to png thing to this local server too...

make sure when first run, that python flask server is started...


we can use that to then stream prices too and say that it would be efficient
to use python cause i then don't have to request new prices each time...

let's say the python will write the new prices as it gets it to a file which both
application can look at... or an api endpoint from where java will request the
latest prices
